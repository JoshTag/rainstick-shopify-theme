Because the system circulates and cleans in real time, you no longer have the requirement of turning off the tap to conserve water.<\/p><p>Additionally, because of circulation we are also not dependent on what the grid supplies and can boost the flow rate. A traditional shower has a flow rate of 1.8-2.2 GPM (depending on the municipality) and RainStick's is approximately 3 GPM.<\/p>"
